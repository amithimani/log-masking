# Log Masking for Sensitive Data in Spring Boot Application

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to mask sensitive data such as email and SSN numbers in the log files of a Spring Boot application using Logback patterns. It provides a simple Spring MVC application with a single GET endpoint `/customer/{id}` that returns customer information. The customer object contains sensitive data fields such as email and SSN numbers, which are masked in the log file to enhance security.

## Project Structure
- **dev.knowledgecafe.logmasking**
    - **HomeController.java**: Contains the controller logic for handling HTTP requests, including the `/customer/{id}` endpoint.
    - **MaskingPatternLayout.java**: Custom Logback pattern layout class for masking sensitive data in log messages.
    - **Customer.java**: POJO class representing the customer object with sensitive data fields.
    - **LogMaskingApplication.java**: Main class to bootstrap the Spring Boot application.

## How It Works
1. When a request is made to the `/customer/{id}` endpoint, the application retrieves customer information from the database.
2. The sensitive data fields (email and SSN numbers) within the customer object are masked before logging.
3. The log messages containing masked sensitive data are written to the log file using Logback's custom pattern layout.

## Getting Started
To run the application locally:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Ensure you have Maven installed.
4. Run `mvn spring-boot:run` to start the Spring Boot application.
5. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080/customer/{id}` in your web browser, replacing `{id}` with the actual customer ID.

## Configuration
- Logback configuration: Customize Logback configuration in `src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml` to adjust logging levels, file appenders, and pattern layout as per your requirements.

## Dependencies
- Spring Boot
- Logback
